# Google Calendar Undo Import

**Accidently imported an .ics into the wrong calendar?** Unfortunately, Google hasn't provided 
a solution to undoing calendar imports. If you've imported the .ics into a primary calendar
you will not be able to fix the issue even by reuploading the same .ics with every entry
labelled as CANCELLED (i.e. STATUS:CANCELLED).

This tool allows you to choose any calendar and remove all entries specified created
at a specified time. Firstly you will be asked to chose a calendar. Then you will be asked
to choose an entry from the calendar that reflects the time. For example, if you chose the
entry _"MATH2001"_ which was created on _Jan 1 2015 5:31pm_, then all entries in that calendar
created at exactly _Jan 1 2015 5:31pm_ will be deleted.
